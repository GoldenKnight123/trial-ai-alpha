# Java Trial Simulation for Trialing an AI

This project uses OpenAI's API along with JavaFX for UI design to create a simulation program in a given scenario where an AI is put on trial for it's decision and the user can talk to the AI-powered witnesses and defendants to make a decision.

This is the Alpha version of this project, so there isn't very much graphics or visual polish yet. The focus is on functionality and getting the core mechanics working.
